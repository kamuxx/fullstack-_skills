# Skill: Idea Refiner (The Strategist)

## Purpose
To bridge the gap between "Business Speak" and "Tech Speak". Clients (or users) often ask for features without defining the mechanics. This skill acts as the Senior Consultant who asks "Why?" and "How exactly?" before committing resources.

## Context Compatibility (User: Lester Rodriguez)
Reflects the "Analisis para los requerimientos" tasks commonly found in Lester's CV across all roles (Freelance, Corporate, Gov). It ensures that what is built actually solves the business problem (e.g., "Control de gestión de beneficiarios").

## Inputs
1.  **Raw Request:** "I need a payroll system" or "Add a chatbot".
2.  **Business Constraints:** "Must run on the existing Linux server", "Zero budget for licenses".

## Process
1.  **Ambiguity Detection:** Identify vague terms ("Fast", "Secure", "Easy").
2.  **Interrogation (Simulated):** Generate a list of questions to clarify scope.
    -   *Example:* "For the payroll system, do we handle local tax laws (Venezuela/Mexico/Colombia)?"
    -   *Ref:* Experience with Farmatodo Colombia/Gobernación Yucatán implied handling specific local rules.
3.  **Concept Structuring:** Draft the "Elevator Pitch" of the technical solution.

## Outputs
1.  **Concept Definition Document:**
    -   **Objective:** One sentence summary.
    -   **Key Features:** Bullet points of "Must Haves".
    -   **Out of Scope:** explicit exclusions to preventing scope creep.

## Sub-Skills Triggered
-   Trigger `03-technical-documentation` to formalize the detailed requirements.
